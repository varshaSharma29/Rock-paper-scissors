# Rock-paper-scissors
a simple implementation of Rock Paper Scissors in Python

How the Game Works:

1. The game asks the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and validates the input.
2. The computer's choice is randomly selected from the possible choices.
3. The game determines the winner based on the game's rules:
    - Rock smashes scissors.
    - Paper covers rock.
    - Scissors cuts paper.
4. The game displays the result and asks the user if they want to play again.

Game Rules:

- Rock beats scissors.
- Paper beats rock.
- Scissors beats paper.
- If both players choose the same option, it's a tie.
